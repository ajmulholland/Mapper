Mapper Software for Roleplaying Games
======

This piece of software has been created as part of a Third year final project which will count towards my final Degree Classification.

It has been created for the Creative Writing course for the module: Writing for Roleplaying games and allows users to create
their individual roleplay maps, quickly and easily.
